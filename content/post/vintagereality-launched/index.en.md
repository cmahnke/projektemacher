The latest addition to the [Project Maker Labs](https://labs.projektemacher.org/) is the "1900 in 3D" category, which has been expanded since the beginning of 2023. This has now been expanded into its own blog: [VintageReality](https://vintagereality.projektemacher.org/) is intended to present old stereoscopic images in various display modes in the future.
