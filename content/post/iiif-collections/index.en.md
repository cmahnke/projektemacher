Many collections, more precisely the blogs created since 2020, are now also available as [IIIF Collections](https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0032-collection/). This means that the image resources can also be [viewed](https://theseusviewer.org/?iiif-content=https://projektemacher.org/collection.json) in an IIIF viewer such as [Theseus](https://theseusviewer.org/).
